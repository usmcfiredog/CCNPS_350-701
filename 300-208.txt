Question 168
SIMULATION -
The Secure-X company has recently successfully tested the 802.1X authentication deployment using the Cisco Catalyst switch and the Cisco ISEv1.2 appliance.
Currently, each employee desktop is connected to an 802.1X enabled switch port and is able to use the Cisco AnyConnect NAM 802.1X supplicant to log in and connect to the network.
Currently, a new testing requirement is to add a network printer to the Fa0/19 switch port and have it connect to the network. The network printer does not support 802.1X supplicant. The Fa0/19 switch port is now configured to use 802.1X authentication only.
To support this network printer, the Fa0/19 switch port configuration needs to be edited to enable the network printer to authenticate using its MAC address. The network printer should also be on VLAN 9.
Another network security engineer responsible for managing the Cisco ISE and has already configured all the requirements on the Cisco ISE, including adding the network printer MAC address to the Cisco ISE endpoint database and etc...
Your task in the simulation is to access the Cisco Catalyst Switch console then use the CLI to:
•	Enable only the Cisco Catalyst Switch Fa0/19 switch port to authenticate the network printer using its MAC address and:
•	Ensure that MAC address authentication processing is not delayed until 802.1X fails
•	Ensure that even if MAC address authentication passes, the switch will still perform 802.1X authentication if requested by a 802.1X supplicant
•	Use the required show command to verify the MAC address authentication on the Fa0/19 is successful
•	The switch enable password is Cisco
For the purpose of the simulation, to test the network printer, assume the network printer will be unplugged then plugged back into the Fa0/19 switch port after you have finished the required configurations on the Fa0/19 switch port.
Note: For this simulation, you will not need and do not have access to the ISE GUI. To access the switch CLI, click the Switch icon in the topology diagram



Correct Answer: Review the explanation for full configuration and solution. Initial configuration for fa 0/19 that is already done:
 
AAA configuration has already been done for us. We need to configure mac address bypass on this port to achieve the goal stated in the question. To do this we simply need to add this command under the interface: mab
Then do a shut/no shut on the interface.
Verification:
 
Question 169
SIMULATION -
The Secure-X company has started to tested the 802.1X authentication deployment using the Cisco Catalyst 3560-X layer 3 switch and the Cisco ISEvl2 appliance. Each employee desktop will be connected to the 802.1X enabled switch port and will use the Cisco AnyConnect NAM 802.1X supplicant to log in and connect to the network.
•	Your particular tasks in this simulation are to create a new identity source sequence named AD_internal which will first use the Microsoft Active Directory (AD1) then use the ISE Internal User database. Once the new identity source sequence has been configured, edit the existing DotlX authentication policy to use the new
•	AD_internal identity source sequence.
•	The Microsoft Active Directory (AD1) identity store has already been successfully configured, you just need to reference it in your configuration.
 
•	In addition to the above, you are also tasked to edit the IT users authorization policy so IT users who successfully authenticated will get the permission of the existing IT_Corp authorization profile.
•	Perform this simulation by accessing the ISE GUI to perform the following tasks:
•	Create a new identity source sequence named AD_internal to first use the Microsoft Active Directory (AD1) then use the ISE Internal User database
•	Edit the existing Dot1X authentication policy to use the new AD_internal identity source sequence:
If authentication failed-reject the access request
If user is not found in AD-Drop the request without sending a response
If process failed-Drop the request without sending a response
Edit the IT users authorization policy so IT users who successfully authenticated will get the permission of the existing IT_Corp authorization profile.
To access the ISE GUI, click the ISE icon in the topology diagram. To verify your configurations, from the ISE GUI, you should also see the Authentication Succeeded event for the it1 user after you have successfully defined the DotlX authentication policy to use the Microsoft Active Directory first then use the ISE
Internal User Database to authenticate the user. And in the Authentication Succeeded event, you should see the IT_Corp authorization profile being applied to the it1 user. If your configuration is not correct and ISE can't authenticate the user against the Microsoft Active Directory, you should see the Authentication Failed event instead for the it1 user.
Note: If you make a mistake in the Identity Source Sequence configuration, please delete the Identity Source Sequence then re-add a new one. The edit Identity
Source Sequence function is not implemented in this simulation.
 









Correct Answer: Review the explanation for full configuration and solution.Step 1: create a new identity source sequence named AD_internal which will first use the Microsoft Active Directory (AD1) then use the ISE Internal User database as shown below:
 
Step 2: Edit the existing Dot1x policy to use the newly created Identity Source:
 
Then hit Done and save.

Correct Answer: D

Question 256
Scenario:
Currently, many users are expehecing problems using their AnyConnect NAM supplicant to login to the network. The rr desktop support staff have already examined and vehfed the AnyConnect NAM configuration is correct.
In this simulation, you are tasked to examine the various ISE GUI screens to determine the ISE current configurations to help isolate the problems. Based on the current ISE configurations, you will need to answer three multiple choice questions.
To access the ISE GUI, click on the ISE icon in the topology diagram to access the ISE GUI.
Not all the ISE GUI screen are operational in this simulation and some of the ISE GUI operations have been reduced in this simulation.
Not all the links on each of the ISE GUI screen works, if some of the links are not working on a screen, click Home to go back to the Home page first. From the Home page, you can access all the required screens.
To view some larger GUI screens, use the simulation window scroll bars. Some of the larger GUI screens only shows partially but will include all information required to complete this simulation.
